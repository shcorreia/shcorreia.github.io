	<h2> Wolbach Library at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics </h2>

    <p> I currently work at the <span style=color:blue; >Wolbach Library</span> in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
      I am the Assistant Community Coordinator for Project PHaEDRA.
    Project PHaEDRA is a project to preserve the work of the Harvard Computers,
    which was a group of female astronomers in the late 19th-early 20th centuries.
    Some of these astronomers include Annie Jump Cannon, Williamina Fleming,
    Cecilia Payne, and Henrietta Swan Leavitt.</p>

<h2> Millicent Library </h2>

    <p>I have worked at the <span style=color:blue; >Millicent Library</span> in Fairhaven, Massachusetts from 2013-present. I started out as a page,
      but for the last three years I have worked at the circulation desk.
      I have continued to work at the Millicent Library on weekends and breaks from college.
      Working at the Millicent Library kindled my interest in creating a career out of working in libraries. </p>

    <p> I feel fortunate to have started out my library career at the Millicent Library because it is a building that is full of history.
      The library was built in 1893 by Henry Huttleston Rogers, a leader in Standard Oil.
      He had the library built in memory of his daughter Millicent, who died at the age of 17.
      Many of my coworkers also attended Simmons University. </p>
